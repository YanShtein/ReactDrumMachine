# ReactDrumMachine

FreeCodeCamp project: building 'React Drum Machine' --> <br/>
https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/front-end-development-libraries/#react-and-redux

This project uses React to build a drum machine.
Project functionality:
- Drum consists of volume controller which controlles the sound of the played pads.
- When clicking each individual drum pad it triggers an audio tag which than plays the src audio.
- An ON/OFF button: 
when turned OFF -> the pad name on screen resets to empty & unable to play the volume.
when ON -> The default behaviour works.

The code has an array of keytrigger objects which I use later to map on for the <div>.
